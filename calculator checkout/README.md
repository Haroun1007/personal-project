# Summation Task

## Description

Develop a basic calculator that computes the sum of numerical values. Begin by displaying a numeric input box on your website. As the user enters a value, dynamically add a second input box below it. Continue this process until the user stops inputting numbers. Once the user finishes typing in the input boxes, automatically calculate the sum of all the values and display the result in a paragraph below the input boxes. As an addition if there is time left, add a plus sign on the left of the input boxes.
