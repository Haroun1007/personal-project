Allow the user to input = input field
smaller and bigger
===============
Variables :
number inputed = inputValue
currentArray = empty array of numbers
smaller number = smallNumbers
bigger number = biggNumber
===============
functions :

onlyNumbers = sorting out characters symbols/ all what not number ..()
compareNumb =   compare who the bigger ()

result = result of subsNumbers ()
printOut = print  result ()

===============
The steps :
1- Ask for numbers
2- chech if we have numbers?
3- we need to allow the user to input only numbers its mean we need a clean result of only numbers
(array of numbers ) ,
Or to make the input field accept only numbers in the input field(as input type="number") ,So here in result we get
an array of only numbers (onlyNumbers)
4- get the numbers 
5- we need to get the smaller index from the bigger (compareNumb ex:we use loop to check each number) , 
6- after comparing we put it in array
7- then we need to substract the smaller from bigger (subsNumbers) by function inlude calculation 
8- we get the result and we save the result in varriable (result) , 
9- after with other function we print the value of result (printOut)
